# Visualize_Emergency_Areas
Prototype that allows users run simulations and visualize the results on a native android platfrom

* A native android application would be developed
* We will be reusing the Web Based Architecture for Geospatial Simulation (WARGS)
* User open up the mobile application
* They set up a simulation experiment
* They run the simulation experiment using the WARGS
* The simulation environment returns simulation results
* The front end application requests geospatial data
* The application matches the results to the geo data, draws and animates the map
